## Reflection

This was a 3 week long project. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build a platform for young and unexperienced writers that allowed them to express their ideas. And while diong so they can gain more insight about their abilities by interacting with other user. Such as their mistakes and weaknesses or their advantages. But during development i realized that it doesn't need to be the only objective. With WPad peaple can share their knowledge about nearly anything from fun stories to differnt tastes in music or questions about some programming issues to an extraordinary experince while traveling. I believe WPad covers enough of the basis needed to accomplish that.

One of the main challenges I ran into was spontaniusly changing user's follow state. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into following patterns.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are AspNetCore, React, React-Router, Redux, MsSql and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and SCSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
